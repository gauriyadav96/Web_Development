# Project Statement

Home4U is an application that will provide rental housing to students, corporates and people in need. This is a hassle-free application that will allow users to post new houses and buy posted houses on rent as per their budgets and needs.

The user will register/login into the application where all the recent posts of houses will be displayed. A user will then be allowed to apply filters based on the budget, number of rooms, location, amenities etc. A user will be able to update their profile at any point in time. A user can also mark their viewed houses as a favorite and can update their favorite shortlisted list. This list can also be downloaded for offline reference. A user can contact the person who has posted the house via email.

User will be able to post new houses along with the images and videos of the apartments. These posted houses can also be updated/modified by the user who has posted the house. User who has posted the house can reply to people who are interested and have sent email for further details via email.

As part of future scope, this application might include a filter of crime rate while looking for the house and a chatbot for the users to communicate immediately with each other.
